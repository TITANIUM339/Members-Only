# Members-Only

A club based message app built with Node.js, Express.js, Passport.js, PostgreSQL, and EJS.

Users can see clubs and messages, but to post a message and see hidden details about other messages users must first signup or login if they have an account and join a club.

To join a club users must first provide a club password which is specified when the club was created.

If you want your club to be open so that anyone can join, provide the password in the club description along with any other information you may want to include.

Admin users can see hidden details of all messages, post messages, delete messages and clubs without having to be a club member, they can basically do everything.

When you create a club you become the owner of that club and thus basically be able to do everything an admin can do but only to that specific club.

Users are able see the hidden details of their own messages and delete them regardless of access rights.
